## Game Instructions
Hogwarts Adventure is a text based python game based on the Harry Potter books from JK Rowling.
The game will start when the user implements their name and a welcome text with game instructions will be displayed.
Based on the user's input they will be assigned a dormitory and the user will be sent on a mission to find the Philosopher's stone and they have to tackle challenges along the way. The user will be asked to implement one of two options for each challenge that will lead them to the next challenge.
Each challenge will have a short story and a description of what the user have to do.
